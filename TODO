- In the NSSearchFieldCell class, when clicking on the lens, the text becomes white but it doesn't disappear, just reclicking in the text editor and the text will appear again.

FIX: 
1) the text should not disappear while clicking on the lens

- NSTextField and NSSearchField should not be resizable in height

- Is NSBox border type settable to the third choice in GORM as default?
